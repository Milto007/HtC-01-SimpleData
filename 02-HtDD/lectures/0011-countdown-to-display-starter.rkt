;; countdown-to-display

; PROBLEM
; You are asked to contribute to the design for a very simple New Year's
; Eve countdown display. You already have the data definition given below.
; You need to design a function that consumes Countdown and produces an
; image showing the current status of the countdown.

;; Data definitions:

;; Coundown is one of:
;; - false
;; - Natural[1,10]
;; - "complete"
;; interp.
;;     - false         means countdown has not yet started
;;     - Natural[1,10] means countdown is running and how many secinods left
;;     - "complete"    means countdown is over
(define CD1 false)
(define CD2 10)        ; just started
(define CD3  1)        ; almost over
(define CD4 "complete")
#;
(define (fn-for-countdown c)
  (cond [(false? c) (...)]
	[(and (number? c) (<= 1 c) (<= c 10)) (... c)]
	[else (...)]))

;; Template rules used:
;; - one of: 3 cases
;;     - atomic distinct: false
;;     - atomic non-distinct: Natural[1,10] 
;;     - atomic distinct: "complete" 

;; Functions:
