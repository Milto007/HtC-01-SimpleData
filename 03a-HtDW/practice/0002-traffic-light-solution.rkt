;; PROBLEM:
; Design an animation of a traffic light.
;
; Your program should show a traffic light that is red, then green,
; then yellow, then red etc. For this program, your changing world
; state data definition should be an enumeration.
;
; Here is what your program might look like if the initial world state was the red traffic light:
; RED
; (underlay (rectangle 50 130 "solid" "black")
;     (above (circle 20 "solid" "red")
;            (circle 20 "outline" "yellow")
;            (circle 20 "outline" "green")))
;
; GREEN
; (underlay (rectangle 50 130 "solid" "black")
;     (above (circle 20 "outline" "red")
;            (circle 20 "outline" "yellow")
;            (circle 20 "solid" "green")))
;
; YELLOW
; (underlay (rectangle 50 130 "solid" "black")
;     (above (circle 20 "outline" "red")
;            (circle 20 "solid" "yellow")
;            (circle 20 "outline" "green")))
;
; Next is red, and so on.
;
; To make your lights change at a reasonable speed, you can use the
; rate option to on-tick. If you say, for example, (on-teck next-color 1)
; then big-bang will wait 1 second between calls to next-color.
;
; Remember to follow the HtDW recipe! Be sure to do a proper domain 
; analysis before starting to work on the code file.
; 
; Note: If you want to design a slightly simpler version of the program,
; you can modify it to display a single circle that changes color, rather
; than three stacked circles.
(define RED-LIGHT 
  (underlay (rectangle 50 130 "solid" "black")
     (above (circle 20 "solid" "red")
            (circle 20 "outline" "yellow")
            (circle 20 "outline" "green"))))
(define GREEN-LIGHT 
  (underlay (rectangle 50 130 "solid" "black")
     (above (circle 20 "outline" "red")
            (circle 20 "outline" "yellow")
            (circle 20 "solid" "green"))))
(define YELLOW-LIGHT 
  (underlay (rectangle 50 130 "solid" "black")
     (above (circle 20 "outline" "red")
            (circle 20 "solid" "yellow")
